AWS Services:
        
      
1- AWS is a comprehensive and widely used cloud computing platform. it offers a vast array of cloud computing services that enable individuals, organisations and businesses to access and utilise computing resources over the internet. AWS is known for its reliability, scalability, and flexibility, making it a popular choice for a wide range of workloads and applications. Core services include:
EC2 (Elastic compute cloud) - virtual servers for running applications
AWS Lambda - Allows you to run code in response to events without provisioning or managing servers
S3 - Scalable object storage for storing and retrieving data
EBS (elastic block store) - block level storage volumes for use with EC2 instances
RDS (Relational Database Service) - managed relational database service that supports multiple database engines like MySQL, PostGreSQL and more.
VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) - allows you to create isolated network environments within AWS Route53 - scalable and highly available domain name system (DNS) web service
IAM (Identity and Access Management) - allows you to manage access to AWS services and resources securely
2- Key components of AWS VPC include:
VPC itself
Subnet
route tables
internet gateway
NAT gateway/NAT instance Elastic IP addresses security groups
NACL (network access control lists)
3- In AWS S3 data is organised into buckets which are top-level containers that store objects. Buckets are like folders at root level, objets are data which can be files of any type. S3 is designed for durability and is highly resistant to data loss, supports versioning and encryption.
Use cases for S3 buckets include:
data storage and backup, static website hosting, data distribution, big data and analytics, media streaming and streaming and data sharing.
4- AWS Lambda is a serverless compute service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It enables you to run code in response to events without the need to provision or manage servers. AWS Lambda follows the serverless computing model, where you can focus on writing code and defining event triggers. Use cases include:
Event Driven execution
Function Execution
Stateless Execution
Automatic Scaling
Resource Management
Granular Billing - paying for the number of invocations and execution duration. Integration with other AWS services
5- EC2 provides virtual machines that you install operating system, runtime and application software on.
 ECS is a container orchestration service that manages docker containers. It abstracts away the underlying infrastructure and focuses on deploying, scaling and managing containerised applications. Load balancing between EC2 instances is typically configured using ELB whereas with ECS integrates seamlessly with ALB (application load balancers) or NLB (network load balancers) to distribute traffic across containers.
6- ELB is a service that automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers and IP addresses. this ensures high availability and faulty tolerance of your applications. The types of load balancers AWS offers include:
application load balancers network load balancers classic load balancers
                        
7- Explain the purpose of Amazon RDS and its benefits. 
RDS is an AWS database tool and due to its design from AWS it works seamlessly with all AWS cloud services providing minimal downtime, highly available and can be managed both from the EC2 console or the AWS CLI.                         
8- What is AWS CloudFormation, and how is it used for infrastructure as code (IaC)?                           
CloudFormation is a service provided by AWS to deploy VPCs. It will take requests from the internet gateway and send traffic to the EC2 instances accordingly which will be set up in availability zones in public and private subnets.
Using CodeDepoly, CodeCommit, CodeBuild and CodePipeline, it creates a CI/CD pipeline to automate changes and you do is monitor, log and troubleshoot.
9- What are AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles, and why are they important?                           
IAM User- provides credentials for a user with a username and security key.
IAM role- this can be used inline with security groups in EC2s and VPCs and because it will have permissions attached to it, it will be more efficiently utilised by the services hosted on the EC2s.
IAM Groups- this allows you to add multiple users of a team to a group who all require the same permissions. This reduces downtime so you don’t have to add the permissions every time a new member joins the team.
10- How does Amazon Route 53 facilitate DNS management in AWS?              
Route53 hosts websites and allows you to assign IP address to the functions in the public or private network.
